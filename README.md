What's Here
-----------

This sample includes:

* branch master - Normal spring boot application with servlet container.
* branch webflux (In progress) - Spring Boot Webflux with Netty server, more functional style (See https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html for details).
* branch distributed-command - This branch uses Netflix Eureka to distribute commands. 

* README.md - this file
* docker-compose.yml - this file is used by Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to running Kafka, Zookeeper and Mongo
* pom.xml - this file is the Maven Project Object Model for the web service
* command-server - this directory contains your Kotlin Service Command source files
* query-server - this directory contains your Kotlin Service Query source files
* sample-core - this directory contains the shared source code between modules, command-server and query-server 
* service-discovery (branch distributed-command) - this directory contains your Service Discovery (Eureka) to enable distributed commands


Getting Started
---------------

To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone project's repository to your
local computer. If you haven't, do that first.

1. Install maven.  See https://maven.apache.org/install.html for details.

2. Install Docker (to run Kafka, Zookeeper and Mongo). See https://docs.docker.com/install/

3. Build the services.

        $ cd sample-cqrs
        $ mvn clean install

4. Run the Docker Compose.

        $ docker-compose up -d

5. Run the Eureka (if distributed-command branch)
        
        $ cd service-discovery 
        $ mvn spring-boot:run 
        
6. Run the Command Server
        
        $ cd command-server
        $ mvn spring-boot:run 

7. Run the Query Server
        
        $ cd query-server
        $ mvn spring-boot:run 

8. Send Command to create the sample data

   action types: 
    
         CREATE
                
         CREATE_AND_CANCEL 
    The action (CREATE_AND_CANCEL) rollback status to CANCELED using [Saga Pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)

        $ curl -v -X PUT \
            http://localhost:8084/command-sample/api/samples \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d '{
            "id": 1234,
            "stuff": "Lorem Ipsum",
            "action": "CREATE"
          }'


9. Call the Query endpoint
        
        $ curl -v -X GET http://localhost:8085/query-sample/api/samples/1234
